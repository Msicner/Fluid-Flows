# Implementation of quantum algorithms for fluid flows simulations
This repository is the code used for implementation of quantum algorithms HHL and VQLS for solving sinulations of heat transfer in flowing fluids. This code has been used in Students' Professional Activity paper.

The impementation is based on publicly accessible libraries:

HHL: https://github.com/anedumla/quantum_linear_solvers/blob/main/linear_solvers/hhl.py

VQLS: https://github.com/QuantumApplicationLab/vqls-prototype/blob/main/docs/tutorials/vqls.ipynb
